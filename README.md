## What is a shell?
A shell is a command line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system and run commands.

## How  the shell works 
*  Display a prompt 
* Reading user input 
* Parsing the command 
* Searching the command 
* Creating a child process
* Executing the command
* Wait for command completion
* Displaying output
* Returning to the prompt
* Exiting the shell
